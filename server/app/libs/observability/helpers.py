"""
Helpers exposed to business code.

Business modules (``routers``, ``services``, …) import only from here. They
never touch OpenTelemetry types directly, so vendor migrations stay isolated
to the ``observability/`` package.

Resilience contract
-------------------
Every helper here MUST guarantee that observability failures (SDK errors,
network timeouts, misconfiguration) cannot leak into business code. If the
backend is misbehaving, callers transparently get a no-op span and the main
flow keeps running. Exceptions originating from the user's ``with``-block body,
on the other hand, are always re-raised — observability never swallows real
business errors.
