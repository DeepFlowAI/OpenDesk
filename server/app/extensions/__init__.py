"""Extension loader for closed-source modules.

This package is intentionally empty in the open-source distribution. Private
deployments overlay closed-source modules into this package before docker
build (see deploy.sh / .github/workflows/deploy.yml).

On startup, every subpackage that defines a top-level callable
``register(app: FastAPI) -> None`` is auto-loaded — typically registering
extra routers or replacing default service implementations.

Adding a new extension is purely additive: drop a new subpackage under
``private/extensions/server/<name>/`` with a ``register(app)`` function;
nothing in the open-source code needs to change.
